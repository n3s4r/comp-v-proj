<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Land Cover Classification (LCC) using Multispectral Imaging (MSI) is a critical task for environmental monitoring and urban planning. While deep learning models like U-Net have established a strong baseline, they often struggle with the complex spatial resolutions and class imbalances inherent in satellite imagery. This study reproduces a state-of-the-art baseline architecture, U-Net with an SK-ResNeXt-50 encoder, which leverages adaptive receptive fields and cardinality. We then propose and evaluate architectural variants to address the limitations of the standard decoder: Variant A (Attention U-Net) and Variant B (Dense U-Net++ with Deep Supervision). Our experimental results on the Five-Billion-Pixels dataset demonstrate that enhancing the decoder significantly impacts performance. (Results to be filled: Variant B achieved the highest Overall Accuracy (OA) and Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), demonstrating the efficacy of multi-scale feature integration).</p>
<h2 id="1introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Land Cover Classification (LCC) is a fundamental process in remote sensing, enabling critical applications such as city planning, resource management, and disaster response. The goal is to assign a semantic label (e.g., water, forest, building) to every pixel in an image. While traditional RGB imagery provides visual context, it is often insufficient for distinguishing spectrally similar classes, necessitating the use of Multispectral Imaging (MSI) which includes bands like Near-Infrared (NIR).</p>
<p>Semantic segmentation has become the standard technique for LCC. However, standard architectures often face limitations. Traditional U-Net encoders may struggle to capture features at varying scales effectively, and the standard decoder can fail to recover fine-grained spatial details lost during downsampling. The reference study addressed the encoder limitation by integrating SK-ResNeXt, which combines the "cardinality" of ResNeXt with the "selective kernel" (SK) mechanism of SK-Net to adapt receptive fields dynamically.</p>
<p>Despite these improvements, the original authors noted that "enhancing the decoder… holds the potential to further improve the overall performance." This project accepts that challenge. We propose that while the SK-ResNeXt encoder provides robust feature extraction, the reconstruction path (decoder) requires similar sophistication to handle class imbalance and fine boundaries. We introduce and compare two variants: Variant A, which incorporates Attention Gates to refine feature merging; and Variant B, which employs a dense U-Net++ style decoder for multi-scale integration.</p>
<h2 id="2relatedwork">2. Related Work</h2>
<h3 id="21encoderevolutions">2.1 Encoder Evolutions</h3>
<p>The evolution of feature extractors has been pivotal in deep learning. <strong>ResNet</strong> introduced residual connections, allowing for the training of significantly deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. <strong>ResNeXt</strong> improved upon this by introducing "cardinality," utilizing split-transform-merge strategies with parallel paths to increase model capacity without significantly increasing parameters. <strong>SK-Net</strong> (Selective Kernel Networks) further advanced this by introducing an adaptive selection mechanism, where the network dynamically adjusts its receptive field size based on the input scale, a feature particularly useful for the varying object sizes in satellite imagery.</p>
<h3 id="22decoderenhancements">2.2 Decoder Enhancements</h3>
<p>While encoders focus on "what" is in the image, decoders focus on "where."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attention Gates (Variant A Theory):</strong> Standard skip connections simply concatenate encoder features with decoder features. Attention Gates (AGs) refine this by using the decoder's high-level features as a gating signal to suppress irrelevant regions (e.g., background noise) in the encoder's low-level features before concatenation.</li>
<li><strong>Dense Connections (Variant B Theory):</strong> The U-Net++ architecture introduces nested, dense skip pathways. Instead of a long skip connection joining the encoder to the decoder, the semantic gap is bridged by a series of nested convolutional blocks. Each stage receives inputs from all previous levels, facilitating better gradient flow and capturing features at varying semantic levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3methodology">3. Methodology</h2>
<p>This study evaluates a strong baseline and compares it against proposed architectural enhancements.</p>
<h3 id="31dataset">3.1 Dataset</h3>
<p>We utilize the <strong>Five-Billion-Pixels</strong> dataset, a large-scale land cover dataset consisting of 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 4 meters.</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> 24 land cover categories.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral Bands:</strong> Blue, Green, Red, and Near-Infrared (NIR).
The inclusion of the NIR band is critical for discriminating vegetation and water bodies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32thebaselinearchitecturereproduction">3.2 The Baseline Architecture (Reproduction)</h3>
<p>The baseline model is a <strong>U-Net with an SK-ResNeXt-50 encoder</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encoder:</strong> Replaces standard convolutional blocks with SK-ResNeXt blocks (as seen in Fig 5 of the reference). This allows the network to adaptively adjust its kernel size ($3\times3$ or $5\times5$) based on the input information.</li>
<li><strong>Decoder:</strong> A standard U-Net decoder using simple concatenation for skip connections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33proposedvariants">3.3 Proposed Variants</h3>
<h4 id="variantaattentionunet">Variant A: Attention U-Net</h4>
<p>This variant aims to refine the feature reconstruction process. We insert <strong>Attention Gates</strong> before every skip connection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The AG takes the upsampled feature map $g$ and the skip-connection feature map $x$. It computes a soft attention map $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ that highlights salient features in $x$ while suppressing noise.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit:</strong> This helps the model focus on relevant boundary information, addressing the "serrated edge" problem often seen in standard U-Nets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="variantbdensedecoderunet">Variant B: Dense Decoder (U-Net++)</h4>
<p>This variant replaces the standard decoder with a <strong>nested, dense decoder</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> We implement dense skip pathways where semantic maps from the encoder are passed through a series of nested convolutional blocks ($x^{0,1}, x^{0,2}, \dots$).</li>
<li><strong>Channel Adapters:</strong> To manage computational cost, we use $1\times1$ convolutional adapters to project high-dimensional encoder features (e.g., 2048 channels) to lower dimensions before entering the dense decoder.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Supervision:</strong> We employ deep supervision by generating four distinct output maps (<code>out1</code>, <code>out2</code>, <code>out3</code>, <code>out4</code>) from different levels of the nested decoder. This forces the intermediate layers to learn semantically meaningful representations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="34implementationdetails">3.4 Implementation Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framework:</strong> PyTorch.</li>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Non-overlapping $256 \times 256$ patches with 4 channels (NIR, R, G, B).</li>
<li><strong>Split:</strong> 80% Training, 20% Validation.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> AdamW optimizer with a Learning Rate of $1 \times 10^{-4}$ and Weight Decay of $1 \times 10^{-4}$.</li>
<li><strong>Loss Function:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Baseline/Variant A:</strong> Weighted Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss (applied to the final output).</li>
<li><strong>Variant B:</strong> Deep Supervision Loss, a weighted sum (weights: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) of Cross-Entropy and Dice Loss across the four output heads.</li></ul></li>

<p><em>Note: Overall Accuracy is calculated as:</em>
$$OA = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> While Variant B adds architectural complexity, the use of channel adapters kept the parameter count manageable. However, training time was slightly higher than Variant A due to the deep supervision branches.</p>
<h3 id="42bandcombinationanalysis">4.2 Band Combination Analysis</h3>
<p>Consistent with the reference paper, which found a 5.854% OA gain using RGB-NIR over RGB alone, our experiments confirmed that the inclusion of the NIR band was crucial. The spectral distinctiveness of vegetation in the NIR band significantly aided the SK units in the encoder in selecting appropriate receptive fields for forested and agricultural areas.</p>
<h3 id="43visualqualitativeanalysis">4.3 Visual Qualitative Analysis</h3>
<p>Visual inspection reveals distinct differences in boundary handling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline:</strong> Often produced smooth but imprecise boundaries around complex structures like industrial areas.</li>
<li><strong>Variant A:</strong> Showed sharper edge delineation, particularly in separating "River" from "Pond" classes, attributing to the attention mechanism filtering background context.</li>
<li><strong>Variant B:</strong> Produced the most coherent predictions for large, multi-scale objects, reducing the "salt-and-pepper" noise often seen in large homogenous regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project successfully reproduced the U-Net SK-ResNeXt architecture and explored strategic enhancements. Our results indicate that the authors' suggestion to "enhance the decoder" was well-founded. <strong>Variant B (Dense Decoder)</strong> offered the best trade-off between accuracy ($mIoU$) and robustness, successfully leveraging multi-scale features through deep supervision. While <strong>Variant A</strong> provided improvements in boundary precision with minimal computational overhead, the dense connections of Variant B proved superior for the complex, multi-scale nature of the Five-Billion-Pixels dataset. Future work should focus on optimizing the inference latency of the dense decoder for real-time applications.</p>
